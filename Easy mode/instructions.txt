2. Install vim

3. Ensure that you can open gVim or MacVim

	gVim should open up like any other PC application - it's not terminal.
	If you are on a Windows computer, it should look like utter dated trash. Don't worry, we will fix this.
	You can open MacVim from the terminal by using `mvim`.

4. Ensure that 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim' exists (for Windows) or YourHomeName/.vim exists (for MacOS)
	
	If not, check 'C:\Program Files\' to see if there is a Vim folder.

	If there is no Vim folder, simply make a new folder called 'Vim' 
	and place it in the 'Program File (x86)' directory.

5. Copy the '_vimrc' and '_gvimrc' in this github 'vim easy mode' folder and put them in the 'Vim' file

6. Relaunch the Vim application.


It should all be working now.





7. Read through the '_vimrc'. Be sure to have a look at the following settings in particular:
	
	'colorscheme'
	'columns' and 'lines'
	'visualbell'
	
	try commenting out
		- listchars
		- rrorbells

8. Adjust text size and font on line 5 of gvimrc

	Try uncommenting lines 10 - 12 in gvimrc
