# ms-vim
This is pretty much everything I have customised for my microsoft version of vim.

Of course, for any of this to work the latest version of vim for windows will need to be installed on your computer.
This suppository only caters for `$MYVIMRC` and for the files within `\vim\vimfiles\`. The `vimXX` e.g. `\vim80\` file has not been altered, and so it has not been placed here.

The bundles are listed, including links to where to dl them, but are not up here for obvious reasons.

Get pathogen first to help download them (if you want), but you don't really need to since you can just download the zip files anyway.

In order for the font to work it will need to be downloaded as well.
