# vim-settings
This is pretty much all my settings for vim.

Of course, for any of this to work the latest version of vim (GVIM, MacVIM, VIM) will need to be installed on your computer.
This suppository only caters for `$MYVIMRC` and for the files within `\vim\vimfiles\`. The `vimXX` e.g. `\vim80\` file has not been altered, and so it has not been placed here.

To install the bundles, simply run `:PluginInstall` from inside vim. This uses Vundle to install/update all plugins listed in the vimrc. Then, simply relaunch the application.

In order for the font to work it will need to be downloaded as well. The font used is Hack for Windows and Monaco for Apple. Source Code Pro is also another great font alternative.
